/*
 
 List - List is an ordered sequence of items. It is one of the most used datatype in Python and is very flexible. 
 All the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.
 Declaring a list is pretty straight forward. Items separated by commas are enclosed within brackets [ ]
 
 Tuples - Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as list.The only difference is that tuples are immutable. 
 Tuples once created cannot be modified.
 Tuples are used to write-protect data and are usually faster than list as it cannot change dynamically.
 It is defined within parentheses () where items are separated by commas.
 
 Set - Set is an unordered collection of unique items. 
 Set is defined by values separated by comma inside braces { }. 
 Items in a set are not ordered.


 Map - Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
 It is generally used when we have a huge amount of data. 
 Dictionaries are optimized for retrieving data. We must know the key to retrieve the value.
 In Python, dictionaries are defined within braces {} with each item being a pair in the form key:value. 
 Key and value can be of any type.
